# name_generator

names.py reads in a list of names, and creates a tennis-tournament style knockout system. I.e. you get a random pair and choose your preferred name. 
**limit** is set to 512 by default (this is the number of input names). You can easily set to 128 or whatever you prefer.
Each round produces an output list, so you can use one of the later rounds as a "shortlist" of preferred names.
